    <p>Hello, my name is Allie Monday. I was born in Dayton, Ohio on Wright Patterson Air Force Base. When I was 9 years old my family relocated to Charlotte, North Carolina when my father got a job with Deloitte as a consultant. I was very active growing up. I played all kinds of sports at least once but mainly I was a competitive dancer. I also spent my free time studying music as well as performing in various musicals throughout Charlotte. In 2013, I graduated high school from Weddington High School. </p>
    <p>I have been a musician since I can remember. I sing as well as play guitar and piano. My passion for music is what sent me to college. I originally started going to Belmont University in Nashville, Tennessee as a Music-Vocal major. Half way through I decided I wanted to switch majors due to the fact that I felt like I was growing as a musician but not growing in my knowledge about how to navigate the nasty and political business itself. I graduated in December of 2017 with a Bachelors of Business Administration degree in Music Business.</p>
    <p>Since graduating I moved back home to Charlotte to have my baby girl. Her name is Cadence Monday and she is my world. Due to a shift in my priorities I have decided to pursue a potential secondary passion of coding. I thoroughly enjoy mathematics, problem solving, and find myself to be creative so I feel like it could be a good path for me. I also feel like web design could be a good asset to play into my degree down the road when I am able to think about music business again seeing as artists, bands, labels, venues, and more in the business always need websites created as well as any web based marketing that takes place.</p>
    <p>I am excited about what is to come in the future and I look forward to growing my education as a mother, musician, and now as a developer.</p>
