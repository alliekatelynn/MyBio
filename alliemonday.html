    <p>Hello, my name is Allie Katelynn Monday. I was born in Dayton, Ohio on Wright Patterson Air Force Base. When I was 9 years old my family relocated to Charlotte, North Carolina when my father got a job with Deloitte as a consultant. In 2013, graduated high school from Weddington High School. </p>
    <p>I have been a musician since I can remember. I sing as well as play guitar and piano. My passion for music is what sent me to college. I originally started going to Belmont University in Nashville, Tennessee as a Music-Vocal major. Half way through I decided I wanted to switch majors due to the fact that I felt like I was growing as a musician but not growing in my knowledge about how to navigate the nasty and political business itself. I graduated in December of 2017 with a Bachelors of Business Administration degree in Music Business.</p>
    <p>Since graduating I moved back home to Charlotte to have my baby girl. Her name is Cadence Monday and she is my world. Due to a shift in my priorities I have decided to pursue a potential secondary passion of coding. I thoroughly enjoy mathematics, problem solving, and find myself to be creative so I feel like it could be a good path for me. I also feel like web design could be a good asset to play into my degree down the road when I am able to think about music business again seeing as artists, bands, labels, venues, and more in the business always need websites created for marketing purposes.</p>
    <p>I am excited about what is to come in the future and I look forward to growing my education as a mother, musician, and now as a developer.</p>
